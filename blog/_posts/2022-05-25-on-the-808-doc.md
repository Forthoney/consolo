This 808 mini-doc has been in the works for a long time and I'm so excited to finally be sharing the initial stages of it with the world.

The whole idea started from a *Music Review* segment I created. After doing some research for the segment (which ended up around 2 minutes long), I was curious enough that I wanted to continue to learn about the device. I had the idea "808 mini-doc" in my ideas box for a long time but I didn't start working on it until the summer of 2021. I began scripting and researching, and produced a first draft. When I recorded the first draft, I was unimpressed. In total, the VO was around 5 minutes long, and lacked a sense of flow and direction. I went back to the drawing board, and re-scripted the entire documentary. It took around two weeks to record, edit, and process, and I ended with around 9 minutes of total VO time.

Since then, I've been working in small chunks on animating visuals to the audio. It's a tedious process, working one or two sentences at a time, creating visuals, and making sure that each portion flows together. I've learned a lot throughout the process and I'm excited to keep working and finish the project.

You can see the state of the project on its page [here][1].
