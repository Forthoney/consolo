### the process
We created a package on Kilwin's, a sweets store in Alpharetta's city center. We had interviews lined up with another local business that may have told a better story, but we had issues when it came to the day of filming. We scrambled to find another location, and settled on Kilwin's as it was nearby. We also had issues filming, as the location we chose led to overexposed footage and windy audio.

### my role
I worked mainly as an editor.
