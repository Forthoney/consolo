### the process
Because I think logically, it was more impactful for me to look at the issue from a numbers perspective. Pulling data from both the GADOT and USDOT, I was able to estimate that the average cost of a serious car accident was around $800,000. To contextualize this, I simply gathered a list of items that could be purchased for that sum, and presented it in a video. The entire video was edited in After Effects.
