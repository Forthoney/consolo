From [*A Time with Isadora*'s official website](https://www.atimewithisadora.org):

A Time with Isadora *is a project of Movement Arts Atlanta centered around the phenomenon of the “Mother of Modern Dance” Isadora Duncan which explores how one artist influences many by integrating historic dance works, new choreography, visual art, photography and filmmaking.*

### my role
I worked under the title "Sound Designer" and performed audio repair for the final edit using tools in both Premiere Pro and Audition.
