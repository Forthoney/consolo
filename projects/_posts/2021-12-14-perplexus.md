A short film shot and edited in two weeks. The prompt was: **Everybody wants to rule the world**.

### the process
We ran into some issues when the SD card containing most of the footage was stolen. Luckily, there were some source media and proxy clips in the trash of the computer I was editing on, so we could recover a majority of the film. We did, however, lose an important scene, so the flow and story took a major hit. In spite of this, I'm still proud of the work we did.

### my role
I worked primarily as a director and editor, but also featured as an actor.
