### the process
We interviewed Aiden Caughy, an Atlanta-based musician and producer. We asked about their journey finding themselves as they experimented with their identity.

### my role
I worked as the lead editor, managing footage, editing direction, and leading secondary edit teams. I also assisted with interview setup and audio recording.
