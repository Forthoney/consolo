### the process
We were tasked with producing a complete short documentary from brainstorming to post-production within a time limit of 8 hours. Our subject was *Mojo Vinyl*, a local record store in Roswell.

We decided to focus on the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on the business and how they helped bring the community together throughout those times.

### my role
I worked primarily as a B-roll shooter and editor.
