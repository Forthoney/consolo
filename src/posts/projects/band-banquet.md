The end-of-year band banquet for the Centennial High School Band program.

### the process
I was tasked with creating a banquet video to replace the normally in-person event. The end result was an 18 minute video that was shared amongst band families to celebrate the accomplishments of the students through the year.

### my role
Over two weeks, I recorded the band director, created graphics, and put together a picture slideshow.
